Ex7:"BMI Calculator: Create a program that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height input. Provide a classification of whether the person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Use cin, cout. Formula: bmi = weight / (height * height)
bmi < 18.5- Underweight
bmi < 24.9- Normal Weight
bmi < 29.9- Overweight
Otherwise- Obese"

Ex8:Nested condition- Get the age and membership_status as user input. membership_status can be only Y or y. So, if the age is bigger or equal to 18 and if the user is a member of our shop, we provide a 10% discount, else we charge fully


Ex9:"Write a program to calculate taxes, with the following conditions:
If the salary is less than $1500, then there are no taxes
If the salary is from 1501 to 3000 $ (1501<= salary < 3000) then the tax should be 10%
If the salary is from 3001 to 5000 $ (3001 <= salary < 5000) then the tax should be 20%
If the salary is above $5000, then the tax should be 30%
Hint: Formula for finding tax (salary * percentage) / 100
You must output:
Tax percentage
Salary after taxes"
